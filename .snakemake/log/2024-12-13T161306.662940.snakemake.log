MissingOutputException in rule create_first in file C:\Users\Danne\R_projects\quarto_reproducibility_workflow\Snakefile, line 11:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 180 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
intermediate_data/filtered_small_seurat_103_obj.rds (missing locally, parent dir contents: filtered_small_seurat_100_obj.rds, filtered_small_seurat_101_obj.rds, small_seurat_100_obj.rds, small_seurat_101_obj.rds, small_seurat_102_obj.rds, small_seurat_103_obj.rds, small_seurat_120_obj.rds, small_seurat_155_obj.rds, small_seurat_62_obj.rds)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
