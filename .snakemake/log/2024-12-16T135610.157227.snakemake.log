MissingOutputException in rule create_first in file C:\Users\Danne\R_projects\quarto_reproducibility_workflow\Snakefile, line 23:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
intermediate_data/filtered_small_seurat_102_obj.rds (missing locally, parent dir contents: filtered_small_seurat_101_obj.rds, small_seurat_101_obj.rds, small_seurat_102_obj.rds)
output/reports/filtered_small_seurat_102_obj.html (missing locally, parent dir contents: dings.html, filtered_small_seurat_101.html, filtered_small_seurat_101_obj.html, small_seurat_102_obj.rds)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
