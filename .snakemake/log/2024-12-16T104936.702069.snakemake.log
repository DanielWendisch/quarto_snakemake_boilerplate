MissingOutputException in rule create_first in file C:\Users\Danne\R_projects\quarto_reproducibility_workflow\Snakefile, line 16:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/reports/filtered_small_seurat_103_obj.html (missing locally, parent dir contents: 1_first.html, 1_first_files, 2_second.html)
Removing output files of failed job create_first since they might be corrupted:
intermediate_data/filtered_small_seurat_103_obj.rds
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
